**Description:**    
 This report provides an overview of a dataset containing information from a survey related to lung cancer. The dataset includes demographic details, lifestyle habits, and medical symptoms that could be linked to lung cancer risk. The primary goal of this study is to analyze potential patterns and correlations between various factors and the presence of lung cancer.  

 The dataset consists of multiple attributes, including:
  - Demographic information: Gender and Age.
  - Lifestyle factors: Smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and peer pressure.
  - Medical symptoms: Chronic diseases, fatigue, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest pain.
  - Indicators of possible tobacco use effects: Yellow fingers and anxiety.
  - Target variable: Lung cancer diagnosis (YES/NO).  

    To gain insights from this dataset, we conducted a statistical analysis focusing on the following aspects:  
      - Identifying patterns of risk factors: Investigating how lifestyle habits and medical symptoms relate to lung cancer occurrence.
      - Assessing the impact of smoking on lung cancer: Exploring correlations between smoking, related symptoms (e.g., yellow fingers, coughing), and lung cancer presence.  

These analyses will provide a deeper understanding of key contributors to lung cancer and potential predictive indicators for early detection.

By examining the dataset statistically, we aim to uncover meaningful insights about lung cancer risk factors and their relationships. The findings could be valuable for preventive strategies and medical research in the future.
